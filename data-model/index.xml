The results of this extraction are stored in a data structure called a Monitor.
Monitors collect together Appearances (blknum.tx_id pairs) along with additional information such as Reconciliations (18-decimal place accurate accounting for each asset transfer), Names (associations of human-readable names with addresses), and Abis which track the &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; of each transaction through its Functions and Parameters.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain data</title><link>/data-model/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:40:11 -0300</pubDate><guid>/data-model/intro/</guid><description>TrueBlocks data On its own blockchain data is an unintelligable blob of binary bytes. But, we all know there is an amazing collection of deeply interesting information contained therein. Thousands of people are trading, voting, expressing thier preferences, making markets for valueless items every minute.
What interests us about this data are answers to questions such as:
What exaclty is going on? Where is my money? Didn&amp;rsquo;t I have some of those tokens somewhere?</description></item><item><title>Unchained index</title><link>/data-model/the-index/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 09:35:59 -0300</pubDate><guid>/data-model/the-index/</guid><description>Benefits of unchaining the index We&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about the Unchained Index elsewhere. We won&amp;rsquo;t belabour the point, however, we want to point out that the Unchained Index:
Allows blazingly fast access to any account anywhere on the chain Allows perfectly-private access to query blockchain data completely locally Naturally shards itself and distributes itself using IPFS and user behaviour Is published periodically to a smart contract and once published cannot be removed from public use Is reproducable directly from immutable data with a well-defined series of operations meaning its as immutable as the original blockchain data Compact Digs deeper into the blockchain than any other source allowing for instantaneous, 18-decimal-place accurate off-chain reconciliation of any account Blazingly fast Links to articles about TrueBlocks Here we present a number of articles we&amp;rsquo;ve written about TrueBlocks over the years.</description></item><item><title>Chain data</title><link>/data-model/chaindata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 07:09:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/data-model/chaindata/</guid><description>These fields describe the output of various TrueBlocks blockchain queries.

Block chifra blocks returns top level data specified block. You can also include an array for the blocks&amp;rsquo; transactions.
The following commands produce and manage blocks:

State The following commands produce and manage states:
Tools The balance of an address at a given block.
CLI: chifra state API State data is made of the following data fields:
Field Description Type blockNumber the block number at which this state was taken blknum balance the balance at the address at the given block height wei nonce the nonce of the address at the given block height uint64 code the byte code at the address (if this is a smart contract) bytes storage this field is un-implemented and current returns the first storage location in a smart contract bytes address the address of the state being queried address deployed the block number at which this smart contract was deployed (if a smart contact) blknum accttype the type of the address at the given block string Result Field Description Type blockNumber the block number at which this call was made blknum address the address of contract being called address signature the canonical signature of the interface string encoding the encoding for the function call string bytes the bytes data following the encoding of the call string callResult the result of the call to the contract CFunction compressedResult the compressed version of the result of the call to the contract string deployed the block number at which this smart contract was deployed (if a smart contact) blknum Token The following commands produce and manage tokens:</description></item><item><title>Admin</title><link>/data-model/admin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 13:27:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/data-model/admin/</guid><description>Tools in the Admin category produce data related to scraping the chain, producing the indexes, and querying the status of the system. Additional data related to sharing the indexes via IPFS and pinning the same are also produced by tools in this category.
Status The chifra status tool reports on the state (and size) of the various TrueBlocks local binary caches. TrueBlocks produces nine difference caches: abis, blocks, monitors, names, objs, prices, recons, slurps, traces, txs.</description></item><item><title>Other</title><link>/data-model/other/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 12:07:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>/data-model/other/</guid><description>These commands call some useful miscellaneous tools:
chifra quotes, a rudimentary pricing tool, chifra explore a quick way to open a blockchain explorer, ethslurp an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of centralization and data quality, see explanation in its section). 👉 Note: some of these tools, like `ethslurp`, require an EtherScan key. Follow these instructions to add a key to your config
